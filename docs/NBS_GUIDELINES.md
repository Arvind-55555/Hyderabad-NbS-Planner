**What it means**: Decisions based on scientific data and openly communicated

**Implementation**:
- Use data-driven analysis (like this tool) to identify priority areas
- Document all assumptions and methodologies
- Share results with stakeholders and the public
- Establish monitoring systems to track outcomes

**For Hyderabad**:
- Leverage open data from GHMC, Telangana Open Data Portal
- Conduct baseline studies before implementation

---

### Principle 2: Inclusive and Participatory

**What it means**: Engage all stakeholders, especially vulnerable communities

**Implementation**:
- Conduct community consultations before finalizing plans
- Involve local residents in design and maintenance
- Consider gender, age, and socioeconomic diversity
- Create feedback mechanisms

**For Hyderabad**:
- Engage Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs)
- Partner with local NGOs (e.g., Hyderabad Urban Lab, GHMC Ward Committees)
- Include informal settlement residents in planning
- Multilingual communication (Telugu, Hindi, Urdu, English)

---

### Principle 3: Achieves Net Gains to Biodiversity
